Feed Reader
===================================
Feed Reader is an application that displays news feed items for configured feeds, allowing you to switch between feeds to retrieve different feed item lists.  It also allows you to click items in the feed to open the source web site for the feed item.

 INSTALLATION
 ==================================
 1. Download the github repository from the following link to a folder on your computer:
   https://github.com/jbrunette/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader
 2. Run the "index.html" of the repository's root folder.

TESTS
===================================
A number of tests have been added to ensure the app performs correctly:

1. Makes sure that there are feeds configured.
2. Ensures that the feeds configured in the app have URL and names associated with them so that they can be loaded properly.
3. Ensures that the menu at the top left opens and closes properly when clicked, and that it is hidden when the app is opened, to make sure other feeds can be accessed.
4. Makes sure that we are able to load the first (initial) feed when the app opens.
5. Verifies that a change of feeds works properly by making sure different items appear.

These tests ensure that the critical application functionality works, allowing you to use the application as expected.
